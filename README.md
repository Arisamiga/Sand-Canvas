# Sand-Canvas

This is a small project inspired by Coding Train's [Falling Sand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4u7Zy_b868) video. 

It is written in Python using the Pygame library. 

The project allows users to have extensive control over the color of the falling sand and the ability to change the sand's color as it falls, if they so choose using the settings menu at the top left of the screen.
